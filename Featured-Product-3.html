     At KCB Pharmaceuticals, we proudly feature Jamieson Calcium + D3 as one of our top-selling vitamins and supplements, a product designed to meet the nutritional needs of individuals seeking to maintain strong bones and overall health. This supplement is particularly essential for those who may not get enough calcium and vitamin D through their diet alone, which is crucial for the prevention of osteoporosis and the maintenance of healthy bones and teeth. Each tablet of Jamieson Calcium + D3 contains 600 mg of calcium, paired with 400 IU of vitamin D3, a combination that is meticulously formulated to enhance calcium absorption in the body. The inclusion of vitamin D3, which is the more effective form of vitamin D, is critical as it aids in the proper utilization of calcium and phosphorus in the body, thereby supporting muscle function and a robust immune system. This product is especially beneficial for older adults, post-menopausal women, and individuals with lactose intolerance who may struggle to consume enough dairy products, which are a primary source of calcium. However, it's not just the elderly who can benefit; athletes and individuals with an active lifestyle will also find Jamieson Calcium + D3 advantageous as it helps to prevent muscle cramps and supports overall physical performance. Moreover, the tablets are free from artificial colors, flavors, and preservatives, making them a natural and safe choice for daily consumption. At KCB Pharmaceuticals, we are committed to providing our customers with high-quality supplements that are both effective and affordable. We understand that dietary needs vary from person to person, which is why we stock a comprehensive range of Jamieson products, from calcium supplements to multivitamins and omega-3 fish oils, ensuring that our customers can find the right product to support their unique health goals.
